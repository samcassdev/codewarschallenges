# Sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5

## Codewars Coding Challenge

Your task is to write function findSum.

Upto and including n, this function will return the sum of all multiples of 3 and 5.

For example:

findSum(5) should return 8 (3 + 5)

findSum(10) should return 33 (3 + 5 + 6 + 9 + 10)

## Learned

In this codewars challenge, I learned how to make best use of for loops to find all of the numbers divisible by 3 and 5.
