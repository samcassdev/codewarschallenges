# Isograms

## Codewars Coding Challenge

An isogram is a word that has no repeating letters, consecutive or non-consecutive. Implement a function that determines whether a string that contains only letters is an isogram. Assume the empty string is an isogram. Ignore letter case.

isIsogram( "Dermatoglyphics" ) == true
isIsogram( "aba" ) == false
isIsogram( "moOse" ) == false // -- ignore letter case

## Learned
Through this coding challenge, I learned how to loop through an array of characters within words and compare those iterations within the array to eachother.
