## Codewars Coding Challenge

Implement a function that adds two numbers together and returns their sum in binary. The conversion can be done before, or after the addition.

The binary number returned should be a string.

## Learned

Through this coding challenge, I learned how to return the binary number and increased my understanding of the while loop.
