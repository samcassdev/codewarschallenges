## Codewars Coding Challenge

Write a function named repeater() that takes two arguments (a string and a number), and returns a new string where the input string is repeated that many times.

Example:
Repeater.repeat("a", 5)
should return

"aaaaa"

## Learned

In this coding challenge, I learned how to return a new string repeatedly.
