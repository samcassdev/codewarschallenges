Who likes keywords? Nobody likes keywords, so why use them?

You know what keyword I use too much? if! We should make a function called _if, with its arguments as a logical test and two functions/lambdas where the first function is executed if the boolean is true, and the second if it's false, like an if/else statement, so that we don't have to mess around with those nasty keywords! Even so, It should support truthy/falsy types just like the keyword.

Example:
_if(true, function(){console.log("True")}, function(){console.log("false")})
// Logs 'True' to the console.
