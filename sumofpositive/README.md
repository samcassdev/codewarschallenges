## Codewars Coding Challenge
You get an array of numbers, return the sum of all of the positives ones.
Example [1,-4,7,12] => 1 + 7 + 12 = 20
Note: if there is nothing to sum, the sum is default to 0.

## Learned
In this challenged, I learned how to calculate the sum of the positive numbers in the array.
