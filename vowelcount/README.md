# Vowel count

## Codewars Coding Challenge

Return the number (count) of vowels in the given string.

We will consider a, e, i, o, and u as vowels for this Kata.

The input string will only consist of lower case letters and/or spaces.

## Learned

Through this challenge, I learned how to follow the loop with a conditional statement in order to make sure that the input string only consists of lower case letters.
